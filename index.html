											<h2>Choir Regulations</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Choir rehearsals take place every Saturday from 2.00pm - 4.30 pm in the Church . All members are expected to attend and be prompt for all rehearsals. If we start on time, we will end on time. Attendance will be recorded at each rehearsal. Members who are not able to attend rehearsal must provide a reason for their absence in advance to the Choir Cord , Assistant Choir Chord or Deciplinary Committie. Those who miss three or more consecutive rehearsals will be placed on probation by the Deciplinary Committie. During the one month probation period, the delinquent member must demonstrate an improvement in attendance. If he/she fails to show improvement, the member will be subjected to removal from the choir.

											During rehearsal, there is to be no eating or texting. Such actions act as a distraction for not only the Choir Chord, but for other members in the choir.
											
											We also strive to keep `Milk n Honey` a source of positivity and productivity. Negative attitudes and 'lazy' mentalities are not acceptable. Staying true to our mission of being a source of prayer, faith, and spirituality, foul behavior prohibits us from achieving this goal. We ask that all participants act in a mature, hardworking, and faith-rooted manner to uplift and encourage themselves and others.
											
											At each rehearsal, concert, and event, we expect that all members give their absolute best. Our choir is a faith filled unit that works together. Never should the weight of the group be pulled by few while others slack in responsibility..</p>

									<h2>Rehearsal Responsibilities</h2>
								</header>
								
								<div class="spotlight">
									<div class="content">
										<p>Each member is responsible to work not only within, but outside of rehearsals. In order to achieve our goals and deadlines in a timely fashion, each member must show dedication and effort.
											To better accommodate the choir and to work more efficiently, the Choir Chord and the Assistant have agreed to make sure every chorister learns to sing their part i.e  to help voice sections learn parts.
											At the beginning of learning new music selections, each member will be given recordings, through our Media, of their voice part that they will be able to take home and independently study. 
											This method must be utilized by all members. Independent study of music is a crucial component of membership in our choir. Each member will be held responsible for knowing voice parts once recordings are provided.
